      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Short-Term Goals:</strong> Set achievable daily or weekly
          goals. For example, mastering a specific passage, improving
          fingerwork, or memorizing a short piece.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Long-Term Goals:</strong> Define broader objectives, such as
          learning a challenging piece, passing an exam, or becoming proficient
          in a particular style of music.
